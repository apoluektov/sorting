- unit-tests: avoid repetition (refactor common test suite for all sorts)
- benchmarking
- copy-paste from benchmarking
- copy-paste from merge sort implementations
- unit tests for all versions of algorithms
- quick, quick-iterative
- comments and documentation
- Makefile madness
- radix sort: seems to not be very efficient

- namespaces: later, when merging with 'steel' project, or when decision made not to merge them
- headers: to 'sorting' dir: same as for namespaces
